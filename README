Combines multiple pdf files to one single file. It depends on the itext pdf manipulating library.

joinpdf was originally written by Mark Thompson but it seems no longer being maintained. The original code used the old version of itext which differed in the package name.

Install the itext library from your package manager or fetch it from http://itext.sourceforge.net

[Compile] 

  javac -classpath /usr/share/java/itextpdf.jar *.java
